# Combining ANOVA And Regression

## Overview

Over the last few weeks of the semester we have been really building up our skills on regression and on ANOVAs and seeing the link between them. Most places would tell you that they are seperate entitites but as you have seen after reading Miller and Haden (2013), after reading Dorothy Bishop's blog, and after working through these labs, they are really just all related. ANOVAs to some degree are just a special type of regression where you have categorical predictors.  But the question you probably now have in your heads is, well if they are the same, can't we merge them, and combine categorical and continuous predictors in some fashion?  Yes, yes we can! And that is exactly what we are going to do to today whilst learning a little bit about screen time and well-being (or wellbeing depending on your preference).
