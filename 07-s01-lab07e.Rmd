library(broom)
ratings <- read_csv("data/07-s01/inclass/GuiltJudgements.csv")
```

Below you will find the solutions to the questions for the Activities for this chapter. Only look at them after giving the questions a good try and speaking to the tutor about any issues.

### InClass Activities

#### InClass Task 1

```{r ch7-task1, eval = FALSE}
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)

ratings <- read_csv("GuiltJudgements.csv")
```

[Return to Task](#Ch7InClassQueT1)

#### InClass Task 2

```{r ch7-task2, results='asis'}
lates <- filter(ratings, Evidence == "Late") %>% 
  select(Participant, Evidence, `12`, `13`) %>% 
  rename(Twelve = `12`, Thirteen = `13`) %>%
  gather(Timepoint, GuiltRating, Twelve:Thirteen)
```

#### InClass Task 3

```{r ch7-task3, results='asis', fig.cap = "Potential Solution to Task 3"}
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(GuiltRating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
 facet_wrap(~Timepoint) +
  labs(x = "GuiltRating", y = NULL) +
theme_bw()
```

[Return to Task](#Ch7InClassQueT3)

#### InClass Task 4

The Task only asks for the boxplot. We have added some additional functions to tidy up the figure a bit that you might want to play with.

```{r ch7-task4, results='asis', fig.cap = "Potential Solution to Task 4"}
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Timepoint,
             y = GuiltRating)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1,2), ylim = c(1,9), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_bw()
```

[Return to Task](#Ch7InClassQueT4)

#### InClass Task 5

We have added color but that was not necessary:

```{r ch7-task5-1, results='asis', fig.cap = "Potential Solution to Task 5"}
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Timepoint,y=GuiltRating))+
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Timepoint), alpha = .2) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()
```

You could even add the `geom_jitter` to have all the data points:

```{r ch7-task5-2, results='asis', fig.cap = "Alternative Potential Solution to Task 5"}
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Timepoint,y=GuiltRating))+
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Timepoint), alpha = .2) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(aes(fill = Timepoint), width = .1, alpha = .2) + 
  theme_classic()
```

#### InClass Task 6

```{r ch7-task6, results='asis'}
descriptives <- lates %>% 
  group_by(Timepoint) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean = mean(GuiltRating),
            sd = sd(GuiltRating),
            se = sd/sqrt(n),
            LowerCI = mean - 1.96*se,
            UpperCI = mean + 1.96*se)
```

```{r hidden-1, include = FALSE}
desc2 <- descriptives %>%
  mutate_at(vars(mean, sd, se, LowerCI, UpperCI),
            webex::round2, digits = 2)
.d12 <- desc2 %>% filter(Timepoint == "Twelve")
.d13 <- desc2 %>% filter(Timepoint == "Thirteen")
```

#### InClass Task 7

* A basic barplot with 95% Confidence Intervals. 
* We have embellished the figure a little but you can mess around with the code to see what each bit does.

```{r ch7-task7-1, results='asis', fig.cap = "Possible Solution to Task 7"}
ggplot(descriptives, aes(x = Timepoint, y = mean, fill = Timepoint)) + 
  geom_col(colour = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#999000", "#000999")) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Twelve","Thirteen")) +
  labs(x = "Timepoint of Evidence", y = "GuiltRating") +
  guides(fill="none") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI),
                position = "dodge", width = .15) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:9), limits = c(0,9)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,9), xlim = c(0.5,2.5), expand = FALSE) +
  theme_classic()
```

* An alternative way to display just the means and errorbars would be to use the pointrange approach. This image shows again the 95% CI

```{r ch7-task7-2, results='asis', fig.cap = "Alternative Solution to Task 7"}
ggplot(descriptives, aes(x = Timepoint, y = mean, fill = Timepoint)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Twelve","Thirteen")) +
  labs(x = "Timepoint of Evidence", y = "GuiltRating") +
  guides(fill="none")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:9), limits = c(0,9)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,9), xlim = c(0.5,2.5), expand = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

#### InClass Task 8

* Remember to set `paired = TRUE` to run the within-subjects t-test

```{r ch7-task8-1, results='asis'}

results <- t.test(GuiltRating ~ Timepoint, 
                  data = lates, 
                  paired = TRUE, 
                  alternative = "two.sided") %>% tidy()
```

```{r ch7-task8-1-table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(results)
```

* Alternatively, using the `filter()` and `pull()` functions to make sure that you are entering the "Thirteen" condition first

```{r ch7-task8-2, results='asis'}

results <- t.test(lates %>% filter(Timepoint == "Thirteen") %>% pull(GuiltRating),
                  lates %>% filter(Timepoint == "Twelve") %>% pull(GuiltRating),
                  paired = TRUE, 
                  alternative = "two.sided") %>% tidy()
```

```{r ch7-task8-2-table, echo =FALSE}
knitr::kable(results)
```

The reason that the two outputs are the same is because the formula (top) method (x ~ y) is actually doing the same process as the second approach, but you are just not sure which is the first condition. This second approach (bottom) just makes it clearer.
`r unhide()`

#### InClass Task 9

A potential write-up for this study would be as follows:

**"A paired-samples t-test was ran to compare the change in guilt ratings before (M = `r descriptives %>% filter(Timepoint =="Twelve") %>% pull(mean)`, SD = `r descriptives %>% filter(Timepoint =="Twelve") %>% pull(sd) %>% round(2)`) and after (M = `r descriptives %>% filter(Timepoint =="Thirteen") %>% pull(mean)`, SD = `r descriptives %>% filter(Timepoint =="Thirteen") %>% pull(sd) %>% round(2)`) the crucial evidence was heard. A significant difference was found (t(`r results %>% pull(parameter)`) = `r results %>% pull(statistic) %>% round(2) %>% abs()`, p = `r results %>% pull(p.value)`) with Timepoint 13 having an average rating `r results %>% pull(estimate) %>% abs()` units lower than Timepoint 12. This tells us that the critical evidence did have an influence on the rating of guilt by jury members."**

When rounding off p-values that are less than .001, rounding will give you a value of 0 which is technically wrong - the probability will be very low but not 0. As such, and according to APA format, values less than .001 would normally be written as p < .001. To create a reader-friendly p-value, then you could try something like the following in your code:

```{r example-1, eval=FALSE}
ifelse(results$p.value < .001, 
       "p < .001", 
       paste0("p = ", round(results$p.value,3))) 
```

So instead of writing **t(`r results %>% pull(parameter)`) = `r results %>% pull(statistic) %>% round(2) %>% abs()`, p = `r results %>% pull(p.value)`**, you would write **t(`r results %>% pull(parameter)`) = `r results %>% pull(statistic) %>% round(2) %>% abs()`, `r ifelse(results$p.value < .001, "p < .001", paste0("p = ", round(results$p.value,3)))`** 

The in-line coding for these options would look like: 

p = `r backtick("r results %>% pull(p.value)")` for p = `r results %>% pull(p.value)`

& 

`r backtick("r ifelse(results$p.value < .001, \"p < .001\", paste0(\"p = \", round(results$p.value,3)))")` for `r ifelse(results$p.value < .001, "p < .001", paste0("p = ", round(results$p.value,3)))`
