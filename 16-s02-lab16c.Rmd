## InClass Activity

1. Like the PreClass we want to spend sometime reflecting on what we have learnt and as such this InClass is about looking at ideas, concepts, and codes, that you have had issue with and seeing if we can resolve those issues. In class we will spend some time looking at any issues you have had along the way.

2. We will also look at some other interesting things you can do in R should you wish to expand your own knowledge and skills. Below is the list we looked at in Semester 1 but I am sure we have found loads more as the year has gone on, such as:

* New

     - **`redoc`** package for collaborative editing of Word documents (https://noamross.github.io/redoc/)
     - **`faux`** for the creation of simulated data (https://debruine.github.io/faux/)
     - **`checkpoint`** for timestamping the version of the packages you are using in your code
     - `mydata <- read.delim("clipboard")` for creating a dataframe from your copy and paste function on your keyboard.
     - **R.Online** to compare codes across different versions of R (https://srv.colinfay.me:1001/)
     - **Hack Your Data Beautiful** (https://psyteachr.github.io/hack-your-data/index.html)
