## Solutions to Questions



Below you will find the solutions to the questions for the Activities for this chapter. Only look at them after giving the questions a good try and speaking to the tutor about any issues.

### InClass Activities

#### Task 1 Question 1

$SS_{total} - SS_{\mu}$ = 91574 - 90000 = 1574

#### Task 1 Question 2

$SS_{sound} / SS_{corrected\ total}$ = 504 / 1574 = 0.32
    
#### Task 1 Question 3

$SS_{err} / SS_{corrected\ total}$ = 1070 / 1574 = 0.68

#### Task 2 Question 1

k = number of conditions, so: 

df = k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

#### Task 2 Question 2

N = 9, and $dfA_{i}$ = 2, so

df = 9 - 2 - 1 = 6
    
#### Task 2 Question 3


```r
ms_a <- dat_ss[["ss_sound"]] / 2L  # 2 is the df for sound
    
ms_a
```

```
## [1] 252
```

#### Task 2 Question 4


```r
ms_err <- dat_ss[["ss_err"]] / 6L  # 6 is the df for error

ms_err
```

```
## [1] 178.3333
```

#### Task 2 Question 5

$\mu_{cafe} = \mu_{jazz} = \mu_{silence}$

#### T3 Question 1


```r
f_obs <- ms_a / ms_err
    
f_obs
```

```
## [1] 1.413084
```

#### T3 Question 2

The red line should be about F = 5.143, meaning that that is the minimum value of F, for those dfs, considered to be statistically significant at $\alpha = .05$

#### T3 Question 3

The approximate p-value for f_obs is p = .317.  

#### T3 Question 4

As $p$ > $\alpha$ we would retain the null hypothesis that there is no significant effect of group

#### T3 Q5 Hint

* look at inputs for the function - ?pf
* ignore ncp
* f_obs = q
* lower.tail? What is the probability of obtaining an F_obs higher than your value.

#### T3 Q5 Answer


```r
pf(f_obs, 2, 6, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```
## [1] 0.3141501
```

#### ezANOVA Solution


```r
dat <- select(dmx, sub_id, typos, sound)

ez::ezANOVA(dat,
            dv = typos,
            wid = sub_id,
            between = sound)
```
