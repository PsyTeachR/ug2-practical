## Assignment

This is a **formative** assignment meaning that it is purely for you to test your own knowledge, skill development, and learning, and does not count towards an overall grade. However, you are strongly encouraged to do the assignment as it will continue to boost your skills which you will need in future assignments. Due to changes to the course schedule, related to the pivot to online teaching as part of the COVID Pandemic, you will be instructed by the Course Lead on Moodle as to when you should attempt this assignment. Please check the information and schedule on the Level 2 Moodle page.
