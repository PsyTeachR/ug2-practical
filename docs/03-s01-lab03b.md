**Testing Mental Rotation Ability**

The data we will use today comes from a recent replication of a classic experiment merging the fields of Perception and Cognition. <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701" target = "_blank">Shepard and Metzler (1971)</a> demonstrated that when participants are shown two similar three-dimensional shapes, one just a rotated version of the other (see the figure below - top panel), and asked participants whether they were the same shape or not, the reaction time and error rates of responses were a function of rotation; i.e. the larger the difference in rotation between the two shapes, the longer it took participants to say "same" or "different", and the more errors they made.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:img-rotation-task)The Mental Rotation Task as shown in Ganis and Kievit (2016) Figure 1</p>
</div>

The image shown in Figure \@ref(fig:img-rotation-task) actually comes from the recent replication, <a href="https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jopd.ai/" target="_blank">Ganis and Kievit (2016)</a>. In the top panel the two shapes are the same but the shape on the right is rotated vertically at 150 degrees from the original (the left shape) and so participants should respond "same". In the bottom panel however the two shapes are different; the one on the right is again rotated at 150 degrees but in this trial it takes longer for participants to realise that they are different shapes. 

You can read more about Ganis and Kievit (2016) in your own time but the basic methods are that they ran 54 participants on a series of these images using 4 angles of rotation (0, 50, 100, 150 degrees) and asked people to respond same or different on each trial. The data can be [downloaded from here](data/03-s01/preclass/ch3-preclass-data.zip). You should use this data to follow along below and try to answer the questions.

**Visualising Data**

1. Download the data folder, unzip it, and save it to a folder you have access to (e.g. your M: drive if using the lab machines).
2. Set your working directory to that folder `Session >> Set Working Directory >> Choose Directory`
3. Open a new Rscript and save it within the folder that contains the data, giving the script a sensible name, e.g. `Lab3_preclass_visualisations.R`
4. Copy the three code lines below into your script and run them to bring `tidyverse` into the library and to read in the two datafiles.


```r
library("tidyverse")

menrot <-read_csv("MentalRotationBehavioralData.csv")
demog <- read_csv("demographics.csv")
```


<div class='solution'><button>Portfolio Point - Why load tidyverse and not just ggplot2?</button>

<div class="info">
<p>This is a really great question as we always seem to be saying to use <code>dplyr</code> or <code>readr</code> or <code>ggplot</code>, but we never actually call them in. Remember however that <code>tidyverse</code> is actually a <strong>collection of packages</strong>, the most common packages in fact, and we use it to bring in these common packages (including <code>ggplot2</code>) because you will probably need the other packages along with it for the codes to run smoothly. We will try to tell you when you need to call other packages alongside <code>tidyverse</code> but do keep in mind that most of your codes will at least start with the <code>tidyverse</code> package.</p>
<p>Small point, if looking for help on <code>ggplot</code>, the package is actually called <code>ggplot2</code>. This is the newer version of the package, so search <code>ggplot2</code> if you need help.</p>
</div>

</div>

<br>
Let's start by having a look at the data we have brought in. You can do this whichever way you choose; we mentioned three ways in the previous labs - check your notes. 

First, `demog` - short for demographics. It has three columns:

* Participant - the ID of the participant
* Age - the age of the participant
* Sex - the sex of the participant

Secondly, `menrot` - short for mental rotation. It has 8 columns:

* Participant - the ID of the participant; matches to `demog`
* Trial - the trial number in the experiment for each participant
* Condition - the name of the image shown; R indicates the rotated image was different
* Time - the reaction time to respond on each trial in milliseconds
* DesiredResponse - what participants should have responded on each trial; Different or Same
* ActualResponse - what participants did respond on each trial; Different or Same.
* Angle - the angle that the shape on the right was rotated compared to the shape on the left (0, 50, 100, 150)
* CorrectResponse - whether the participant was correct or incorrect on a given trial


<div class='solution'><button>Portfolio Point - A nice procedure</button>

<div class="info">
<p>Ganis and Kievit (2016) is a very short paper that is really to introduce the stimuli set rather than give an extensive background on the topic of mental rotation - we call this a ‘methods paper’. That said, the writing of the paper is very clear and the procedure is well detailed as to how they ran the actual experiment. When writing a procedure, remember to give as much information as needed to allow someone to exactly replicate your study. Have a read at this procedure when you have time and think about what information is there, <strong>but also what information is not there</strong>, to help you develop your writing and your reports. For example, which fingers did the participants use to respond and why would that be important?</p>

**Creating Some Plots**

We now have our data and we want to create some plots to visualise it. We will show you the code to create four types of plots and then get you to practice more yourself in the labs, but you will remember some of this from Level 1 and you should edit/change the codes we give you and see what changes you can create - this is a great way of working. Be sure to bring any questions with you to the lab.


<div class='solution'><button>Portfolio Point - A note on how ggplot works</button>

<div class="info">
<p>The two main things to know about working with <code>ggplot</code> are that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>the usual format is:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>ggplot(data, aes(x = x_axis, y = y_axis)) + geom_type_of_plot()</code></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>it works on a concept of <strong>layers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at point a: The first thing you enter is your dataframe, your <code>data</code>. Then within the <code>aes()</code> you say what is my <code>x_axis</code> and <code>y_axis</code>, using the column names from within your dataframe. <code>aes</code> stands for aesthetics and maps data into visual features. Finally you tell the code what type of plot you want.</p>
<p>On point b: Layers are a common way for graphics to work. Think about it as creating your first layer and then adding more layers on top to create the figure you want. The first layer is always your data and the x and y axes. The second layer, added by using the plus symbol ‘+’, is the type of plot. We will look at adding more layers as we progress.</p>
<p><code>ggplot()</code> is an incredibly powerful package that is used by a whole range of industries, including newspapers and mainstream media outlets, as it can make quite sophisticated images.</p>
</div>

</div>
  

### Scatterplots - `geom_point()`

Scatterplots are a great way of visualising **continuous** data - data that can take any value on the scale it is measured. For example, you can use scatterplots to explore the relationship between two continuous scales such as Age and Reaction Time: Do both variables increase at the same rate? Does one variable increase and the other decrease? Or maybe there is no overall relationship?

In our data, say we want to test if the overall average time to respond in the mental rotation task is affected by age of participant. We could show this in a scatterplot. The code below: 

1. Wrangles the data to create an average response time for each participant, `Mean_Time`, and then joins this information to the demographic data, by `Participant`. All this is stored in `menrot_time_age`. 
2. It then plots a scatterplot (`geom_point()`) where `age` is plotted on the x axis, and `Mean_Time` is on the y axis
3. Finally, it uses an additional `aes` call to `color` by `Sex` which will color each point based on whether it was a male or female participant responding:  


```r
menrot_time_age <- group_by(menrot, Participant) %>% 
  summarise(Mean_Time = mean(Time, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  inner_join(demog, "Participant")

ggplot(data = menrot_time_age, 
       aes(x = Age, 
           y = Mean_Time, 
           color = Sex)) +
  geom_point()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="03-s01-lab03b_files/figure-html/dim1-1-1.png" alt="A scatterplot of Mean Time as a function of Age" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:dim1-1)A scatterplot of Mean Time as a function of Age</p>
</div>


<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--green);">Quickfire Questions</span>

* Looking at the scatterplot in Figure \@ref(fig:dim1-1), what can you say about the relationship between age and overall response time? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["there is no overall relationship"]'> <option></option> <option>as age increases, overall response time increases</option> <option>as age increases, overall response time decreases</option> <option>there is no overall relationship</option></select>

* Looking at the scatterplot, what can you say about difference between male and female participants? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["there is no real difference between males and females in terms of overall response time and age"]'> <option></option> <option>males show more of an increase in overall response time with age than females</option> <option>females show more of an increase in overall response time with age than males</option> <option>there is no real difference between males and females in terms of overall response time and age</option></select>


<div class='solution'><button>Explain This - I don't get these answers</button>

<div class="info">
<p>You will have covered correlations briefly before but that is essentially what the first question is asking. If you look at the figure, does it appear that as age increases (x axis) so does overall resposne time (y axis)? Or as age decreases so does overall response time? Or maybe even as age increases, overall response time decreases? Etc etc. Well, actually, looking at the figure there appears to be no relationship between the two variables at all and it is not the case that as one either increases or decreases so does the other. The relationship appears flat.</p>
<p>When comparing sex, based on the color of the dots, again there appears to be no major differences here as the relationship looks flat for both sex.</p>
</div>

</div>
  
<br>
**Note**: It will often be the case that to visualise data you first have to wrangle it into a format. When we do this we will be using the functions we saw in Chapter 2, so make sure you have been through those tasks and have understood what the wrangle verbs are doing and how pipes work. Keep in mind that most functions use the format, `function(data, argument)`

### Histograms - geom_histogram()

Histograms are a great way of showing the **overall distribution** of your data. Is it skewed? Does it look normal? Is it peaky? Is it flat? These are terms that will be familiar to you through the statistics lectures so try to think about them when visualising your data.

Looking at our data, say we wanted to test if the overall distribution of mean response times for correct trials was normally distributed. The code below: 

1. Wrangles the data to create an average response time for each participant, `Mean_Time`, and then filters this information for correct trials only. This is then stored in `menrot_hist_correct`
2. Plots a histogram (`geom_histogram()`) where `Mean_Time` is plotted on the x axis, and the count of each value in `Mean_Time` is plotted on the y axis. The code creates the y axis automatically and we don't have to state it:    


```r
menrot_hist_correct <- group_by(menrot, Participant, CorrectResponse) %>% 
  summarise(Mean_Time = mean(Time, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(CorrectResponse == "Correct")

ggplot(data = menrot_hist_correct, 
       aes(x = Mean_Time)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="03-s01-lab03b_files/figure-html/dim2-1-1.png" alt="A histogram of distribution of Mean Time counts" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:dim2-1)A histogram of distribution of Mean Time counts</p>
</div>

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--green);">Quickfire Questions</span>

* Looking at the histogram in Figure \@ref(fig:dim2-1), what can you say about the overall shape of the distribution? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["the data looks reasonably normally distributed"]'> <option></option> <option>the data looks reasonably normally distributed</option> <option>the data looks positively skewed</option> <option>the data looks negatively skewed</option></select>

* Looking at the histogram, what is the most common average overall response time for correct trials? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["approximately 2500 milliseconds"]'> <option></option> <option>approximately 2000 milliseconds</option> <option>approximately 2500 milliseconds</option> <option>approximately 3000 milliseconds</option></select>


<div class='solution'><button>Explain This - I don't get these answers</button>

<div class="info">
<p>Keep in mind that real data will never give that beautiful textbook shape that you see in classic diagrams when looking for normal or skewed data. Your decisions regarding your distributions will often requre a degree of judgement.</p>
<p>From your lectures you will remember that positive skewed data means that most of the data is shifted to the left (low numbers) with a tail stretching to the right (high numbers). Negative skew is where most of the data is shifted to the right (high numbers) with a tail stretching to the left (low numbers). Normal data has most of the data in the middle with even tails on either side. Although not perfect, the data shown in our histogram is a good representation of normal data in the real world.</p>
<p>As the y axis is the count of the values on the x axis, the most common overall response time can be found by reading the highest column of the data. For this distribution, this looks to be around 2500 milliseconds or 2.5 seconds.</p>
</div>

</div>
  

### Boxplots - geom_boxplot()

Boxplots are a great means for visualising the **spread** of your data and highlighting **outliers**. When looking at boxplots, you should consider: Whether the box is skewed or not? Whether the median is in the middle or to one side? Are the box whiskers a similar length on both sides? Are there any outliers - usually highlighted as a star or a dot beyond the whiskers? 

Looking at our data, let's look at and compare the distributions of mean reaction times for correct and incorrect responses. The code below:

1. Repeats the first two wrangle steps as when we created a scatterplot, but additionally groups by `CorrectResponse`, and stores the data in `menrot_box_correct`
2. Plots a boxplot (`geom_boxplot()`) of the overall average response times on the y-axis, `Mean_Time`, split by the condition `CorrectResponse` on the x-axis 
3. Uses an additional `aes` call to `fill` the colour of the boxplots, of the two categories, based on whether `CorrectResponse` was correct or incorrect.
4. Turns off the legend using the `guides()` call as it isn't needed because the x-axis tells you which group is which. More on that later though.


```r
menrot_box_correct <- group_by(menrot, Participant, CorrectResponse) %>% 
  summarise(Mean_Time = mean(Time, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  inner_join(demog, "Participant")

ggplot(data = menrot_box_correct, 
       aes(x = CorrectResponse, 
           y = Mean_Time, 
           fill = CorrectResponse)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="03-s01-lab03b_files/figure-html/dim4-1-1.png" alt="A boxplot of the spreads of Mean Time for Correct and Incorrect Responses" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:dim4-1)A boxplot of the spreads of Mean Time for Correct and Incorrect Responses</p>
</div>

<span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; color: var(--green);">Quickfire Questions</span>

* Looking at the boxplots, how many outliers were there? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["0"]'> <option></option> <option>1</option> <option>2</option> <option>3</option> <option>0</option></select>

* Looking at the boxplots in Figure \@ref(fig:dim4-1),, which condition had the longer median overall average response time to the mental rotation task? <select class='solveme' data-answer='["Median response time was longer for the Incorrect responses"]'> <option></option> <option>Median response time was longer for the Correct responses</option> <option>Median response time was longer for the Incorrect responses</option> <option>Both medians are the same approximately</option></select>


<div class='solution'><button>Explain This - I don't get these answers</button>

<div class="info">
<p>There are a number of ways of determining outliers which will be discussed in more detail in your lectures. You can do it through standard deviations (usually 2.5 or 3 SD are used as cut-offs) or do it with boxplots where an outlier is determined as 1.5*IQR (inter-quartile range) above or below the top and bottom of the box. Outliers are shown as dots (unless changed) above or below the whiskers of the boxplot. As you can see in the figure, there are no outliers to see in this data.</p>
<p>The median is one of the 5 values required to make a boxplot and is shown as the thick black line within the box itself. Looking at the two conditions and comparing the position on the y axis (response time) we can see that the median response time for incorrect trials was higher than correct trials, meaning that people take longer to think on the trials that they get wrong - makes sense if you think about it, uncertainty takes longer and leads to more errors.</p>
</div>

</div>
  

### Barplots - geom_bar() or geom_col()

Barplots typically show the **average value of a condition**, e.g. the mean, and the **average spread of values** via **error bars**, e.g. standard error. We don't show error bars here below but you will learn about them at a later point. When looking at barplots, the main considerations are whether or not there appears to be a difference between the conditions you are interested in or are all conditions about the same? It is worth knowing that barplots are now used less frequently than they were as they actually do not show a lot of information, as discussed in this blog, <a href="https://garstats.wordpress.com/2016/03/09/one-simple-step-to-improve-statistical-inferences/" target = "_blank">One simple step to improving statistical inference</a>. However, you will still see them in the field so it is good to be able to interpret them. 

Looking at our data, let's say we are interested in whether there is a difference in the average percentage of correct and incorrect responses across male and female participants. The code below:

1. Wrangles the data through a series of steps to establish the overall percent average for correct and incorrect responses for both sex, stored in `menrot_resp_sex`. 
2. Plots a barplot (`geom_bar()`) with the condition `Sex` on the x axis, the `Avg_Percent` on the y axis, created through the wrangle, and `fill` the bars based on `CorrectResponse`
3. Finally, within the `geom_bar` it says to treat the data as final values and not to average them, `stat = "identity"`, and makes both columns visible by moving them apart `position = position_dodge(.9))` - without this last step the bars would overlap and you wouldn't see everything. Try changing the `.9`


```r
total_n_trials <- 96

menrot_resp_sex <- count(menrot, Participant, CorrectResponse) %>% 
  inner_join(demog, "Participant") %>%
  mutate(PercentPerParticipant = (n/total_n_trials)*100) %>%
  group_by(Sex, CorrectResponse) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Percent = mean(PercentPerParticipant))

ggplot(data = menrot_resp_sex, 
       aes(x = Sex, 
           y = Avg_Percent, 
           fill = CorrectResponse)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", 
           position = position_dodge(.9))
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="03-s01-lab03b_files/figure-html/dim5-1-1.png" alt="A barplot of the average percent Correct and Incorrect responses for Female and Male participants - using geom_bar()" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:dim5-1)A barplot of the average percent Correct and Incorrect responses for Female and Male participants - using geom_bar()</p>
</div>
<br>

`geom_col()` - short for column - is an alternative to `geom_bar()` that does not require the part of the code where you say to not do anything to the data, i.e. `stat="identity"`. This is shown below. Notice the difference in codes but that they produce the same figure!


```r
ggplot(data = menrot_resp_sex, 
       aes(x = Sex, 
           y = Avg_Percent, 
           fill = CorrectResponse)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(.9))
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="03-s01-lab03b_files/figure-html/dim6-1-1.png" alt="A barplot of the average percent Correct and Incorrect responses for Female and Male participants - using geom_col()" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:dim6-1)A barplot of the average percent Correct and Incorrect responses for Female and Male participants - using geom_col()</p>

<div class='solution'><button>Explain This - I don't get these answers</button>

<div class="info">
<p>Remember that in barplots the top of the column is the average value of that condition. This is actually why people do not like barplots; though commonly used, they really only show you one value for your data, the average, and they disregard all other information unless some indication of spread is given.</p>
<p>With that in mind, comparing the two Correct columns we can see that females had on average more correct responses than males. Doing the same for the Incorrect columns, we can see that males had more incorrect responses than females. This actually makes sense as the response option in the experiment was either correct or incorrect, so when you add all the correct and incorrect percentage responses for one sex together you should get 100%. If females gave more correct reponses then they must have given less incorrect responses.</p>
<p>The last two questions are about playing with the code. Remember we said that plots work through a concept of layers. If you set <code>position.dodge()</code> to 0, you will find that one of the columns disappears because they completely overlap now. So we need to set <code>position.dodge()</code> to a reasonable value to have the columns separate. Why not set it at 1? In barplots you often find that <strong>the different levels (or categories) of the the same variable are touching</strong>. Note however that the value of the dodge, in this case 1, is relative to the size of the x axis - if the scale of your x-axis ran from 0 to 100 then a dodge of 1 will have very little effect.</p>
<p>The final point shows that you can add a lot more calls than just x and y axis to change the presentation of your figures. <code>fill</code> changes the color of the columns, <code>color</code> changes the outline color of the columns. We will see more of these as we progress and we will look at the difference between putting them inside the <code>aes()</code> and outside of it. Have a play about with these on other figures and see what happens.</p>
</div>

</div>


### Themes, Labels, Guides, and **`facet_wraps()`**

Before we finish, we want to mention a couple of other layers you can add to your `ggplot` calls to make your figures look more professional. We will show you the code here but we want you to run them and teach yourself how they work by changing the code, removing parts within ggplot, and by adding them to the other figures we have shown above. Bring any questions you have about these functions to the upcoming lab.

* `themes` - changing the overall presentation of your figure. Try running the below code and comparing the figure to the barplot above. Remember, `?theme_bw()` will give some information or look at the cheatsheets for different themes.

* `labels` - putting appropriate labels on your figures so readers understand what is being displayed. Try changing the text within the quotes.

* `facet_wraps` - splitting data into separate figures for clarity. This will only work when one of your conditions is categorical but it can be a really effective means of displaying information.

* `guides` - remove it and see what happens. Do you understand why we use `fill` in this situation but perhaps not others?

Try running and editing this code.


```r
total_n_trials <- 96

menrot_better_plot <- count(menrot, Participant, CorrectResponse) %>% 
  inner_join(demog, "Participant") %>%
  mutate(PercentPerParticipant = n/total_n_trials) %>%
  group_by(Sex, CorrectResponse) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Percent = mean(PercentPerParticipant))

ggplot(data = menrot_better_plot, 
       aes(x = Sex,
           y = Avg_Percent, 
           fill = CorrectResponse)) + 
  geom_col(position = position_dodge(.9)) +
  labs(x = "Sex of Participant", 
       y = "Percent Average (%)") +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~CorrectResponse) +
  theme_bw()
```

**A figure for all occasions**

As you progress through Psychology you will come across a variety of different figures and plots, each looking slightly different and giving different information. When looking at these figures, and indeed when choosing one for your own analyses, you have to think about which figure is the most appropriate for your data. For example, scatterplots are great when both variables are continuous; boxplots and histograms are great for viewing spreads of data; barplots are commonly used where one variable is categorical - but as above note that barplots can be misleading and lots of new approaches to display categorical information are being created. Always keep asking yourself, does my plot display my data correctly. We will look more at this in upcoming labs and lectures where we will also work on improving our interpretation of figures.
