# Visualisation Through **`ggplot2`**

## Overview

In the last lab we encouraged you to always be looking at your data, making sure you are understanding your data and paying attention to how it is made up in regards to data types. A second way of looking at your data is through visualisation - figures and plots - to help understand patterns and effects in your data. For example, when we asked you about the relationship between age and the Ponzo illusion in Lab 1. 

Visualisation is very important for understanding your data, for example in regards to seeing differences between groups, but also for seeing where things don't quite match up with what you think is happening. A great example of this is Anscombe's Quartet, which you can read up about at a later date if you like - <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet" target = "_blank">see here</a>. The key point is that it is always good to visualise your data and visualisation should be a common step in your practical skill set.

Last year you learnt a bit about data visualisation using `ggplot2`, the main visualisation package of `tidyverse`, and you can find more info here if you like: <a href = "http://ggplot2.org/" target = "_blank">ggplot2</a>. Today we will revisit plotting data and expand your skills in order to make effective and informative figures. This will become really beneficial to you as your progress through University and is a skill that applies to multiple careers, not just Psychology.

In this lab you will:

1. Recap on visualisation
2. Expand your skills to produce new figures
3. Learn about Mental Rotation
