#### Task 9

<div class="solution"><button>Possible Solution Task 9</button>

"A paired-samples t-test was ran to compare the change in guilt ratings before (M = 5.8, SD = 1.5) and after (M = 4.04, SD = 1.93) the crucial evidence was heard. A **significant** difference was found (t(74) = 8.23, p = 4.7113406\times 10^{-12}) with Timepoint 13 having an average rating 1.76 units lower than Timepoint 12. This tells us that the critical evidence did have an influence on the rating of guilt by jury members"."

Actually, the p-value above is a bit silly and would normally be written as p < .001 but we used code to create this paragraph and the code for the p-value is a bit more complicated than just rounding:

`ifelse(round(results$p.value,3) == 0, .001, round(results$p.value,3))` and would return p < 0.001
