## Solutions to Questions



Below you will find the solutions to the questions for the Activities for this chapter. Only look at them after giving the questions a good try and speaking to the tutor about any issues.

### InClass Activities

#### InClass Task 1


```r
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)

ratings <- read_csv("GuiltJudgements.csv")
```

#### InClass Task 2



```r
lates <- filter(ratings, Evidence == "Late") %>% 
  select(Participant, Evidence, `12`, `13`) %>% 
  rename(Twelve = `12`, Thirteen = `13`) %>%
  gather(Timepoint, GuiltRating, Twelve:Thirteen)
```

#### InClass Task 3


```r
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(GuiltRating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~Timepoint) +
  labs(x = "GuiltRating", y = NULL) +
theme_bw()
```

#### InClass Task 4

We have added a couple of extra lines to tidy up the plot


```r
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Timepoint,
             y = GuiltRating)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1,2), ylim = c(1,9), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_bw()
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task4)Potential Solution to Task 4</p>
</div>

#### InClass Task 5

We have added color but that was not necessary


```r
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Timepoint,y=GuiltRating))+
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Timepoint), alpha = .2) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="07-s01-lab07e_files/figure-html/ch7-task5-1-1.png" alt="Potential Solution to Task 5" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task5-1)Potential Solution to Task 5</p>
</div>

You could even add the `geom_jitter` to have all the data points


```r
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Timepoint,y=GuiltRating))+
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Timepoint), alpha = .2) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(aes(fill = Timepoint), width = .1, alpha = .2) + 
  theme_classic()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="07-s01-lab07e_files/figure-html/ch7-task5-2-1.png" alt="Alternative Solution to Task 5" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task5-2)Alternative Solution to Task 5</p>
</div>

#### InClass Task 6


```r
descriptives <- lates %>% 
  group_by(Timepoint) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean = mean(GuiltRating),
            sd = sd(GuiltRating),
            se = sd/sqrt(n),
            LowerCI = mean - 1.96*se,
            UpperCI = mean + 1.96*se)
```

#### InClass Task 7

Bar plot with 95% Confidence Intervals. We may have embellished the figure a little, but you can mess around with it to see what each bit does.


<div class='solution'><button>Possible Solution Task 7</button>


```r
ggplot(descriptives, aes(x = Timepoint, y = mean, fill = Timepoint)) + 
  geom_col(colour = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#999000", "#000999")) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Twelve","Thirteen")) +
  labs(x = "Timepoint of Evidence", y = "GuiltRating") +
  guides(fill="none") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI),
                position = "dodge", width = .15) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:9), limits = c(0,9)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,9), xlim = c(0.5,2.5), expand = FALSE) +
  theme_classic()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="07-s01-lab07e_files/figure-html/ch7-task7-1-1.png" alt="Possible Solution to Task 7" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task7-1)Possible Solution to Task 7</p>
</div>

An alternative way to display just the means and errorbars would be to use the pointrange approach. point_range with 95% CI


```r
ggplot(descriptives, aes(x = Timepoint, y = mean, fill = Timepoint)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Twelve","Thirteen")) +
  labs(x = "Timepoint of Evidence", y = "GuiltRating") +
  guides(fill="none")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:9), limits = c(0,9)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,9), xlim = c(0.5,2.5), expand = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="07-s01-lab07e_files/figure-html/ch7-task7-2-1.png" alt="Alternative Solution to Task 7" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task7-2)Alternative Solution to Task 7</p>
</div>

#### InClass Task 8


```r
results <- t.test(GuiltRating ~ Timepoint, data = lates, paired = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided") %>% tidy()
```

#### InClass Task 9

A potential write-up for this study would be as follows:

"A paired-samples t-test was ran to compare the change in guilt ratings before (M = 5.8, SD = 1.5) and after (M = 4.04, SD = 1.93) the crucial evidence was heard. A **significant** difference was found (t(74) = 8.23, p = 4.7113406\times 10^{-12}) with Timepoint 13 having an average rating 1.76 units lower than Timepoint 12. This tells us that the critical evidence did have an influence on the rating of guilt by jury members"."

Actually, the p-value above is a bit silly and would normally be written as p < .001 but we used code to create this paragraph and the code for the p-value is a bit more complicated than just rounding:

`ifelse(round(results$p.value,3) == 0, .001, round(results$p.value,3))` and would return p < 0.001
