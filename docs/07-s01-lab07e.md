## Solutions to Questions



Below you will find the solutions to the questions for the Activities for this chapter. Only look at them after giving the questions a good try and speaking to the tutor about any issues.

#### InClass Task 2


```r
lates <- filter(ratings, Evidence == "Late") %>% 
  select(Participant, Evidence, `12`, `13`) %>% 
  rename(Twelve = `12`, Thirteen = `13`) %>%
  gather(Timepoint, GuiltRating, Twelve:Thirteen)
```

#### InClass Task 3

* facet_wrap() is a great way to have more than one plot in the same figure.


```r
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(GuiltRating)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "GuiltRating", y = NULL) +
  facet_wrap(~Timepoint) +
  theme_bw()
```

#### InClass Task 4

The Task only asks for the boxplot. We have added some additional functions to tidy up the figure a bit that you might want to play with.


```r
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Timepoint,
             y = GuiltRating)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1,2), ylim = c(1,9), expand = TRUE) +
  theme_bw()
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task4)Potential Solution to Task 4</p>
</div>

#### InClass Task 5

* To get the boxplot on top of the violin plot remember to call the boxplot after the violin. Think about the layers!


```r
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Timepoint,y=GuiltRating))+
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Timepoint), alpha = .2) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="07-s01-lab07e_files/figure-html/ch7-task5-1-1.png" alt="Potential Solution to Task 5" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task5-1)Potential Solution to Task 5</p>
</div>

* You could even add the `geom_jitter` to have all the data points


```r
lates %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Timepoint,y=GuiltRating))+
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Timepoint), alpha = .2) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +
  geom_jitter(aes(fill = Timepoint), width = .1, alpha = .2) + 
  theme_classic()
```

<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task5-2)Alternative Solution to Task 5</p>

#### InClass Task 6


```r
descriptives <- lates %>% 
  group_by(Timepoint) %>%
  summarise(n = n(),
            mean = mean(GuiltRating),
            sd = sd(GuiltRating),
            se = sd/sqrt(n),
            LowerCI = mean - 1.96*se,
            UpperCI = mean + 1.96*se)
```

#### InClass Task 7

* A basic barplot with 95% Confidence Intervals. 
* We have embellished the figure a little but you can mess around with the code to see what each bit does.


```r
ggplot(descriptives, aes(x = Timepoint, y = mean, fill = Timepoint)) + 
  geom_col(colour = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#E2A458", "#61589C")) +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Twelve","Thirteen")) +
  labs(x = "Timepoint of Evidence", y = "GuiltRating") +
  guides(fill="none") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI),
                position = "dodge", width = .15) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:9), limits = c(0,9)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,9), xlim = c(0.5,2.5), expand = FALSE) +
  theme_classic()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="07-s01-lab07e_files/figure-html/ch7-task7-1-1.png" alt="Possible Solution to Task 7" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task7-1)Possible Solution to Task 7</p>
</div>

* An alternative way to display just the means and errorbars would be to use the pointrange approach. This image shows again the 95% CI


```r
ggplot(descriptives, aes(x = Timepoint, y = mean, fill = Timepoint)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = LowerCI, ymax = UpperCI))+
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Twelve","Thirteen")) +
  labs(x = "Timepoint of Evidence", y = "GuiltRating") +
  guides(fill="none")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(1:9), limits = c(0,9)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,9), xlim = c(0.5,2.5), expand = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="07-s01-lab07e_files/figure-html/ch7-task7-2-1.png" alt="Alternative Solution to Task 7" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:ch7-task7-2)Alternative Solution to Task 7</p>
</div>

#### InClass Task 8

* Remember to set `paired = TRUE` to run the within-subjects t-test


```r
results <- t.test(GuiltRating ~ Timepoint, data = lates, paired = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided") %>% tidy()
```

#### InClass Task 9

A potential write-up for this study would be as follows:

**A paired-samples t-test was ran to compare the change in guilt ratings before (M = 5.8, SD = 1.5) and after (M = 4.04, SD = 1.93) the crucial evidence was heard. A significant difference was found (t(74) = 8.23, p = 4.7113406\times 10^{-12}) with Timepoint 13 having an average rating 1.76 units lower than Timepoint 12. This tells us that the critical evidence did have an influence on the rating of guilt by jury members.**

Actually, the p-value above is a bit silly and would normally be written as p < .001 but we used code to create this paragraph and the code for the p-value is a bit more complicated than just rounding. If you wanted to create a more reader-friendly p-value, then you could try something like the following:

`ifelse(round(results$p.value,3) == 0, .001, round(results$p.value,3))` 

Which when run, would return as p < 0.001
