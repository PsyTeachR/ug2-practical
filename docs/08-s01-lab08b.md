### Reading

Read the following blog on Power. This is a bit of a lengthy blog on a fictional conversation between a professor and a student on the importance on power. Grab a coffee and have a read. Don't worry about reading all the additional papers; just the blog is fine to get an understanding.

Remember to make notes about power, effect sizes, and sample sizes, as processing the concepts into your own words will really help you understand them better.
