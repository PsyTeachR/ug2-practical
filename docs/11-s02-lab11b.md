## PreClass Activity

### Read

As preparation, please read chapters 1 to 3 of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1fyuTuvj3YoaFdUR3FZaXNuNXc/view", target = "_blank">Miller and Haden (2013)</a>. 

This is quite a lot of reading, and don't worry if you don't understand it all first time. The best way to look at it will be to read through as prep, get the gist, then use it to support the class activity and re-read to consolidate knowledge for the assessment. In this week's inclass lab activity we will be working up to Sums of Squares - around section 3.4
