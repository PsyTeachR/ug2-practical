### Homework Activities

#### Question 1

Consider the following description of a study.

> You are investigating whether there is seasonal variation in students' bodyweight. In other words, is there any evidence that bodyweight differs across the four seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall - #AllYouGotToDoIsCall)?

Which of the models shown below would be the the general linear model corresponding to this study?

1. $Y_{ij} = \mu + A_{ij} + S(A)_{ij}$
2. $Y_{ijkm} = \mu + A_{i} + B_{j} + C_{k} + D_{m} + S_{ijkm}$
3. $Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + e_{ij}$
4. $Y_{ijkm} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \beta_4 X_4 + e_{ijkm}$

Replace the NULL in the Q1 code chunk with the statement number that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4).


```r
mcq1 <- 1
```

----

For the next few questions consider the decomposition matrix for a one-factor design with three groups, shown below .

|$i$ | $j$ | $Y_{ij}$ | $\hat{\mu}$ | $\hat{A}_{i}$ | $\widehat{S(A)}_{ij}$
|---:|----:|---------:|------:|---------:|-----------:|
|1   |   1 | 4        | 6     |  -1      |  -1        |
|1   |   2 | 6        | 6     |  -1      |   1        |
|2   |   1 | 4        | 6     |   0      |  -2        |
|2   |   2 | 8        | 6     |   0      |   2        |
|3   |   1 | 2        | 6     |   1      |  -5        |
|3   |   2 | 12       | 6     |   1      |   5        |

#### Question 2

According to the above decomposition matrix, the population grand mean is estimated to be:

1. 0
2. 6
3. 36
4. can't answer; not observed

Replace the NULL in the Q2 code chunk with the statement number that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4).


```r
mcq2 <- 2
```

#### Question 3

According to the above decomposition matrix, the value of $\hat{A}_3$ is:

1. 6
2. 0
3. 1
4. can't answer; not observed

Replace the NULL in the Q3 code chunk with the statement number that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4).


```r
mcq3 <- 3
```

#### Question 4

According to the above decomposition matrix, the predicted value for a participant in group 1 is what? 

**Hint**: this is the "fitted" or "typical" for that group ($\hat{Y}_{ij}$) as opposed to the actual value ($Y_{ij}$)

Replace the NULL in the Q4 code chunk with the actual value of the correct answer (e.g a number).


```r
Q4 <- 5  # replace NULL with your answer (a number)
```

#### Question 5

Which observation or observations has/have the largest residual(s)?

1. $Y_{21}$
2. $Y_{21}$ and $Y_{22}$
3. $Y_{31}$
4. $Y_{31}$ and $Y_{32}$

Replace the NULL in the Q5 code chunk with the statement number that corresponds to the correct answer (e.g. 1, 2, 3 or 4).


```r
Q5 <- 4
```

#### Question 6

From your reading of Miller and Haden Chapter 3, and from the inclass activity Section 5, based on the above decomposition matrix, what would $SS_{total}$ be for this model?

Replace the NULL in the Q6 code chunk with the actual value of the correct answer (e.g a number).


```r
Q6 <- 4^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 8^2 + 2^2 + 12^2  # replace NULL with your answer (a number)
Q6 <- 280

Q6
```

```
## [1] 280
```

#### Question 7

From your reading of Miller and Haden Chapter 3, and from the inclass activity Section 5, based on the above decomposition matrix, what would $SS_{error}$ be for this model?

Replace the NULL in the Q7 code chunk with the actual value of the correct answer (e.g a number).


```r
Q7 <- (-1)^2 + 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 2^2 + (-5)^2 + 5^2  # replace NULL with your answer (a number)
Q7 <- 60

Q7
```

```
## [1] 60
```

#### Question 8

From reading Miller and Haden Chapter 3, and from the inclass activity Section 5, a study with a one-factor design with GLM $Y_{ij} = \mu + A_{ij} + S(A)_{ij}$ is found to have the following SS:

* $SS_{total} = 280$, 
* $SS_{\mu} = 40$, 
* and $SS_{error} = 60$.  

Given those values, what is the value of $SS_{A}$?

**hint:** $SS_{total}$ = $SS_{\mu}$ + $SS_{A}$ + $SS_{error}$ 

Replace the NULL in the Q8 code chunk with the actual value of the correct answer (e.g a number).


```r
Q8 <- 180 # replace NULL with your answer (a number)

Q8
```

```
## [1] 180
```


#### Question 9: Create your own decomposition matrix

Finally, this last task tests your ability to set up a decomposition matrix as shown inclass. The code chunk below creates the basic table structure you will need to complete this task. Run the code and have a look at the table, but DO NOT CHANGE IT!


```r
## run this block, have a look at the structure of dsetup,
## but don't change anything

library("tidyverse")

dsetup <- tibble(i = rep(1:4, each = 3),
                 j = rep(1:3, times = 4),
                 Yij = NA,
                 mu = NA,
                 Ai = NA,
                 err = NA)
```

In the code chunk below, flesh out the values in `dsetup` to create a decomposition matrix for the data shown below (a one-factor design with four levels), but with the actual numeric values replacing the NA values.

- Group 1: 84, 86, 61
- Group 2: 83, 71, 95
- Group 3: 56, 95, 92
- Group 4: 68, 76, 93

**IMPORTANT**!

- Make sure the **final table with your result** has the name `dmx`.  Check spelling and capitalization.
- The values should be computed based on the `Yij` values such that if the `Yij` values were to change then your code would still produce the correct decomposition matrix.
- **DO NOT** change the column names, the column ordering, and make sure it has the right number of rows and columns. You should have 12 rows by 6 columns.
- Make sure your code runs without error in a fresh R session, and make sure no warnings are generated by the code chunk named `dmx_warning`, which validates your response.


```r
# TODO: DO STUFF WITH dsetup

# you can change or remove the line below,
# but make sure your final table is called dmx
dmx <- dsetup %>%
  mutate(Yij = c(84, 86, 61,
                 83, 71, 95,
                 56, 95, 92,
                 68, 76, 93),
         mu = mean(Yij)) %>%
  group_by(i) %>%
  mutate(Ai = mean(Yij) - mu) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(err = Yij - (mu + Ai))

dmx
```

```
## # A tibble: 12 x 6
##        i     j   Yij    mu    Ai   err
##    <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
##  1     1     1    84    80    -3     7
##  2     1     2    86    80    -3     9
##  3     1     3    61    80    -3   -16
##  4     2     1    83    80     3     0
##  5     2     2    71    80     3   -12
##  6     2     3    95    80     3    12
##  7     3     1    56    80     1   -25
##  8     3     2    95    80     1    14
##  9     3     3    92    80     1    11
## 10     4     1    68    80    -1   -11
## 11     4     2    76    80    -1    -3
## 12     4     3    93    80    -1    14
```




**Finished**

Well done, you are finshed! Now you should go check your answers against the solution file which can be found on Moodle. You are looking to check that the resulting output from the answers that you have submitted are exactly the same as the output in the solution - for example, remember that a single value is not the same as a coded answer. Where there are alternative answers it means that you could have submitted any one of the options as they should all return the same answer. If you have any questions please post them on the moodle forum or on the <a href = "https://rguppies.slack.com", target = "_blank">rguppies.slack.com</a> forum **#level2_2018**.

See you in the next lab!
