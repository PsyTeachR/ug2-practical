## PreClass Activity

### Read

Re-read Chapter 3 of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1fyuTuvj3YoaFdUR3FZaXNuNXc/view", target = "_blank">Miller and Haden (2013)</a> and make sure you are understanding it. Particularly focus on how the decomposition matrix leads to the ANOVA output through sums of squares, dfs, and mean squares. 

### Try

To test your understanding, work through Computational Exercise #1 in section 3.12 of Miller and Haden (page 31) all the way to the summary table. The answer is in section 3.13 but be sure to work through the example first. You should also review the probability labs and lectures from semester 1 as we move on to understanding F distributions and p-values.
