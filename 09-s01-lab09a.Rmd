# Reflection - Semester 1

## Overview

We have covered a lot of material in these labs and now would be a good time to stop, recap, and reflect on what we have learnt.  As such, this lab is more about looking back at what you have learnt, testing your skills, resolving issues, and looking at other cool applications of R that have not been covered in this lab series.
