## PreClass Activity

As we are reflecting in this lab, your PreClass activities this time are:

1. Review the labs from this semester and note any issues you have with the elements covered - both in terms of concepts and code.

2. Post these issues on <a href = "https://moodle.gla.ac.uk" target = "_blank">the Practical labs forum on Moodle</a> and bring them to the lab.
